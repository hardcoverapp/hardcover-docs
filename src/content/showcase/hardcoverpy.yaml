description: |
  HardCoverPy is a Python client library that provides a streamlined interface to interact with the Hardcover GraphQL API. It abstracts away query building, authentication, and response parsing into Python objects.

  Features:
  - Query the Hardcover API using Python objects instead of raw GraphQL
  - Automatic query building from YAML schema definitions
  - Filtering with dot-path syntax for nested fields
  - Pydantic models for type-safe response parsing
  - Support for ordering, pagination, and distinct queries
  - Schema validation to check available fields and operators

  Currently in beta with read-only support.
