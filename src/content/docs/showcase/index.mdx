## Add Your Project

Built something cool with the Hardcover API? We'd love to feature it!

### What It Takes to Be Featured

Featured projects appear in the carousel at the top of the page and get extra visibility. To be considered for featuring, your project should meet these criteria:

**Required:**
- **Uses the Hardcover API** - Your project should integrate with Hardcover's GraphQL API
- **Available to the community** - Must be publicly accessible, open source, or available for download (not just a personal demo or proof of concept)
- **Complete submission** - Include author name with GitHub and/or Hardcover username, working links, and appropriate categories
- **English screenshots** - Screenshots must be in English for featuring (this may change in the future)

**Recommended:**
- **Quality screenshots** - 2-4 screenshots showing your project in action, reasonable file size (under 500KB each)
- **Detailed description** - Explain what your project does, its key features, and how it uses Hardcover
- **Active maintenance** - Project should be functional and reasonably maintained

Projects without screenshots or with non-English screenshots can still be listed but won't be eligible for featuring.

### How to Submit

1. Fork the [docs repository](https://github.com/hardcoverapp/hardcover-docs)
2. Create a new file: `src/content/showcase/your-project-slug.yaml`
3. Add any screenshots to `public/showcase/your-project-slug/`
