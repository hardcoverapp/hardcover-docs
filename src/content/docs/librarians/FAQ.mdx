## General
### How do I get help as a librarian when I have a question?
First step: this document! Read through and see if there’s an answer to your question here.

If not, then join our Discord. Don’t worry, you don’t need to be an expert in Discord. We mostly use it as a group chat for people on Hardcover, with a few special channels for Librarians and Supporters. Once you’ve joined Discord, you’ll need to connect Discord with your Hardcover account to gain access to the #librarians channel. You can follow instructions in this article to add the “librarian” role (or “supporter”), which will grant you access.

### When combining duplicate books/series/authors, which version should you keep?
In the case of Authors, series and characters, keep the one with the canonical English name.

For books, choose the one with the most readers using it. When another reader selects that book to read, we’ll default the “edition” that reader read to be the primary edition for this book. By selecting the book with the most readers, that means the next people who read it will also be assigned the same popular edition.

### If you’re an approved librarian, can you also become a supporter?
Librarians get some additional benefits that supporters get for free, including edit ability across the site. We have a plan to add Bulk Edit and Filtering for lists with some Supporter/Librarian only features as well.

## Access

### How do I join the Hardcover Discord for Librarians?

## Privileges

### What privileges do librarians get?
Librarians can edit most fields of books, editions and authors. In the future, librarians will also be able to edit series, characters and other book related data.

### What privileges do supporters get?
Supporters get the same permissions as librarians as long as they remain supporters.

### What’s to stop a librarian from messing up a book/author/etc?
For books/editions with a high 'read score' - generally anything with 5 or more reads - there is a check in place that sends significant changes, such as merges or deletes, to the head librarian's queue for approval before the change is applied. That said, librarians have a lot of power - if you're ever unsure about an action you're taking, please ask first!

### If you’re an approved librarian, can you also become a supporter?
Yes, please do - Hardcover would love to have your support! Supporters retain the full edit permisions of a librarian. Librarians get many of the benefits that supporters get for free, including edit ability across the site.

## Bugs and Issues
### How do I report bugs?
First off, I’m sorry you’ve run into a bug. We’ve been trying to move as fast as possible, and that has meant keeping a lot of plates spinning in the air. Sometimes they crash down and we need to fix things. 😅

Hop on [Discord](https://discord.gg/edGpYN8ym8) and join the [#librarians](https://discord.com/channels/835558721115389962/1105918193022812282) channel. Post there about any bugs you’re running into.

### My update didn’t work? What’s going on?
This is a bug Adam’s currently working on getting to the bottom of. If you run into this, you can either skip that book for now, or start a thread in the librarian channel with as much information as possible to help reproduce the error (link to the page you were editing, what fields you changed).
