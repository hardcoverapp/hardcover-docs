## General
### How do I get help as a librarian when I have a question?
First step: this document! Read through and see if there’s an answer to your question here.

If not, then join our Discord. Don’t worry, you don’t need to be an expert in Discord. We mostly use it as a group chat for people on Hardcover, with a few special channels for Librarians and Supporters. Once you’ve joined Discord, you’ll need to connect Discord with your Hardcover account to gain access to the #librarians channel. You can follow instructions in this article to add the “librarian” role (or “supporter”), which will grant you access.

### If you’re an approved librarian, can you also become a supporter?
Yes, please do - Hardcover would love to have your support! Supporters retain the full edit permisions of a librarian, but also get a few extra perks.

## Access

## Privileges

### What privileges do librarians get?
Librarians can edit most fields of books, editions and authors. In the future, librarians will also be able to edit series, characters and other book related data.

### What privileges do supporters get?
Supporters get the same edit permissions as librarians as long as they remain supporters. Supporters also get additional benefits on the site, such as Supporter flair and early access to the staging environment to provide feedback and help shape the future of Hardcover.

### What’s to stop a librarian from messing up a book/author/etc?
For books/editions with a high 'score' - generally anything with 5 or more reads - there is a check in place that sends significant changes, such as merges or deletes, to the head librarian's queue for approval before the change is applied. That said, librarians have a lot of power - if you're ever unsure about an action you're taking, please ask first!

## Bugs and Issues
### How do I report bugs?
First off, I’m sorry you’ve run into a bug. We’ve been trying to move as fast as possible, and that has meant keeping a lot of plates spinning in the air. Sometimes they crash down and we need to fix things. 😅

Hop on [Discord](https://discord.gg/edGpYN8ym8) and join the [#librarians](https://discord.com/channels/835558721115389962/1105918193022812282) channel. Post there about any bugs you’re running into.
