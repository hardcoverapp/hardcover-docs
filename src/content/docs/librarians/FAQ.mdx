## Known issues
*Before checking out the FAQ, please be aware of the following known issues:*

- There are known issues around the propagation of deduplicated authors to editions. This is being actively worked on and should be resolved in the near future.
- It is known that random book covers have been assigned to author pages throughout the site. We're aware of this and are working on a fix.
- If a book is a member of a series but isn't appearing on the series page, please check if the book has a value other than a number in the `Place in series (text)` field. If it does, please remove anything that isn't a number (Vol., tome, short story titles) and save the book. The book should then appear on the series page.
- It is known that publisher merges don't stick after a book with a merged publisher is edited.

## Frequently Asked Questions

*While the Librarian docs are fairly comprehensive, there are a few questions that come up often enough that it makes sense to address them here.*

### What's to stop a librarian from messing up a book/author/etc?
For books / editions / with a high `impact_score`, meaning anything with five or more reads, there is a check in place that requires a member of the Hardcover Senior Librarian team’s approval before the change takes place.

### How do I report bugs?
Hardcover is under active development, and sometimes things break as we add features. We want to fix issues as soon as possible, so thank you for your reports and patience! 😅

The best way to report a bug is via <a href={URLS.BUGS_DISCORD} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a>. Head to the #bugs channel and do a quick search to check whether the current issue has already been posted. If not, provide details such as: links to the page you were editing, what actions were taken, and what happened as a result (especially if there was an error message or weird behavior).

Screenshots can help if applicable (including console output if you’re comfortable with your browser’s dev tools). By reporting in Discord, other <a href={URLS.LIBRARIAN_DISCORD} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#librarians</a> or developers can confirm if it’s a known bug or offer a workaround while a fix is being worked on.

We truly appreciate bug reports, they help us improve the site for everyone!
