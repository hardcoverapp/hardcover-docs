## General
### How do I get help as a librarian when I have a question?
First step: this document! Read through and see if there‚Äôs an answer to your question here.

If not, then join our Discord. Don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt need to be an expert in Discord. We mostly use it as a group chat for people on Hardcover, with a few special channels for Librarians and Supporters. Once you‚Äôve joined Discord, you‚Äôll need to connect Discord with your Hardcover account to gain access to the #librarians channel. You can follow instructions in this article to add the ‚Äúlibrarian‚Äù role (or ‚Äúsupporter‚Äù), which will grant you access.

### When combining duplicate books/series/authors, which version should you keep?
In the case of Authors, series and characters, keep the one with the canonical English name.

For books, choose the one with the most readers using it. When another reader selects that book to read, we‚Äôll default the ‚Äúedition‚Äù that reader read to be the primary edition for this book. By selecting the book with the most readers, that means the next people who read it will also be assigned the same popular edition.

### If you‚Äôre an approved librarian, can you also become a supporter?
Librarians get some additional benefits that supporters get for free, including edit ability across the site. We have a plan to add Bulk Edit and Filtering for lists with some Supporter/Librarian only features as well.

## Bugs and Issues
### How do I report bugs?
First off, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve run into a bug. We‚Äôve been trying to move as fast as possible, and that has meant keeping a lot of plates spinning in the air. Sometimes they crash down and we need to fix things. üòÖ

Hop on [Discord](https://discord.gg/edGpYN8ym8) and join the [#librarians](https://discord.com/channels/835558721115389962/1105918193022812282) channel. Post there about any bugs you‚Äôre running into.

### My update didn‚Äôt work? What‚Äôs going on?
This is a bug Adam‚Äôs currently working on getting to the bottom of. If you run into this, you can either skip that book for now, or start a thread in the librarian channel with as much information as possible to help reproduce the error (link to the page you were editing, what fields you changed).
