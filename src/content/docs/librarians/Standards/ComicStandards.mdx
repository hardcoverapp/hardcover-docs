`{Series} ({Year})`

    <details>
        <summary>Examples:</summary>
        Saga

        The Amazing Spider-Man (2018-2022)

### Trade Paperbacks

`{Series} ({Year}) (TPBs)`

    <details>
        <summary>Examples:</summary>
        The Sandman (TBPs)

        The Amazing Spider-Man (2012-2022) (TBP)
    </details>

### Other Collections (Hardcover, Omnibus, Book, etc)

`{Series} ({Year}) (Collection Name)`

    <details>
        <summary>Examples:</summary>
        Saga (Compendiums)
    </details>

The "primary" series (aka the series name with no additional qualifiers in the name and the shortest slug) is the most regularly released format of the series. For series that release in issues, the issues would be the primary series. If a series is released only in TPBs or Volumes, this would be the primary series.

Year is an optional field used to differentiate different comic runs under the same series name. Years for series names should use the full range of the series for completed runs or the first year and a hypen for ongoing runs.

    <details>
        <summary>Examples:</summary>
        Wonder Woman (1987-2006)

        Wonder Woman (2003-)
    </details>

Collections of works (such as TBPs for series released as issues and all other collections) should be marked as a "Compilation" with the contained issues added. The collections should be added as a "Featured" series of that format of work but not to any of the series of the books comprising the collection (E.g., The Sandman: Book Two would be added as the second item in "The Sandman (Books)" but not to "The Sandman" or "Vertigo: Winder's Edge").
