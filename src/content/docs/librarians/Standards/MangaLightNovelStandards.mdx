## Series Naming Conventions

<ImageComponent imagePath="/src/content/images/librarians/manga_series_naming.png" description="Example of light novel series naming on Hardcover" />

As with [books](../bookstandards/#what-title-should-we-use-for-the-book) of any kind, we should use the official English title whenever possible with manga and light novels.

If the series is only available in Japanese (meaning there are no English editions), retain the original Japanese title using Romaji (Latin alphabet) in square brackets.

**Example:**
- 小悪魔ティーリと救世主!? [Koakuma Teeri to Kyuuseishu!?]

If the series has been translated into other languages but not English, use the same format. Use the original edition as the Book's cover edition.

If an English edition exists, use the official English title and the English edition as the Book's cover edition.

<Aside type="note">
It's recommended to rename series as a last step as there are currently known issues around Goodreads imports creating a duplicate series which would have to be merged.

If a series slug contains a year or appears unnecessarily long, it may be possible to reclaim a shorter slug reserved from past deduplication. Report these to the Hardcover team for assistance.

### Disambiguating Light Novels from Manga

Some series exist in both manga and light novel formats. To help users distinguish between the two, it's necessary to disambiguate.

We recommend appending either "(Manga)" or "(Light Novel)" to the series title when both formats exist. The text in parentheses should be title-cased.

**Examples:**
- Classroom of the Elite (Light Novel)
- Classroom of the Elite (Manga)

## Volume Titles and Numbering

Naming conventions and disambiguation may vary from publisher to publisher or across other book data platforms. Hardcover sets its own standards to maintain consistency.

For books and all editions of manga and light novels, we follow the format:

`{Series Title} ({Disambiguation}), Vol. {num}: {Subtitle}`

Again, the text in parentheses should be title-cased. If a series has no disambiguation, that part may be omitted. That is expected for series published in only one format in its original language.

**Examples:**
- My Hero Academia (Manga), Vol. 2: Rage, You Damned Nerd
- Overlord (Light Novel), Vol. 1: The Undead King
