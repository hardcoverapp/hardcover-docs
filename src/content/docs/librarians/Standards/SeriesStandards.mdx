## Duplicate Series Names
For multiple series with the same name, adjust the additional series as follows:
  - Append `(Author Name)` to the series name 
  - Append `-AuthorName` to the slug

When a series has been adapted into a different format (e.g., a manga that was novelized), we create a separate series for the adaptation:
  - The source format retains the series name (e.g., `The Summer Hikaru Died`)
  - For the adaptation, append `(Format)` to the series name (e.g., `The Summer Hikaru Died (Light Novel)`
  - For the adaptation, append `-format` to the slug (e.g., `the-summer-hikaru-died-lightnovel`)


## Publisher Collections (E.g., Penguin Little Black Classics)
For publisher or other collections where only a specific edition of a book is part of the series, a Hardcover series should not be created. The book may be instead added to a list.
