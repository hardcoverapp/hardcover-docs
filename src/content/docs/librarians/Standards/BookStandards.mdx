## Adding new books

If by searching Hardcover you cannot find a specific book, there are two methods for adding one to the database: 

1. ISBN or an external ID for a supported platform.
2. Manually

These functions are available to all users of Hardcover and the results are made immediately public to everyone. If the book you’re looking for exists, but a specific Edition of it does not, use [these instructions](/librarians/standards/editionstandards/#adding-editions) instead.

### Creating a book by ISBN or External ID

This is the most straightforward and preferred method of adding a new title to Hardcover. In addition to ISBN 10/13 lookups, Hardcover supports imports from select external platforms such as Open Library, Google Books, and Goodreads.

From the [Add Book to Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/books/new) page, select the type of identifier you have available from the dropdown, paste the ID, and click “Save.” If the book is found, its details will be imported with metadata automatically prefilled. You will be redirected to the imported edition.

As a librarian, it is your responsibility to review the imported details for any discrepancies. Importing information saves a lot of time, but mistakes on one platform shouldn't persist on Hardcover. Please review an imported edition's details after creation.

<Aside type="note">
If your newly added book doesn’t immediately appear in search results, it could be due to a caching or indexing delay. If it doesn’t appear within a day or so, reach out on Discord.
</Aside>

### Creating a book manually
There will be occasions where a book has no ISBN or presence on other book platforms, making importing its details impossible. This is common with self-published or very old books predating ISBN assignment.

In these cases, from the [Add Book to Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/books/new) page, select "Title" from the "What do you know about the book?" dropdown. This will guide you through an advanced search tool to ensure that a duplicate of the book is not created.

If there are no matching results available to enrich, you will be presented with an option to manually create a book. This may appear at the end of a list of near matches, so scroll to the bottom to find a link to proceed.

Using this option creates a new edition. Please refer to that guidance for filling out the form.

## Merging Duplicates
There are many reasons a duplicate book might appear. Translations, imports, and unmapped edition creation can lead to additional copies of a single book appearing on Hardcover. Librarians can report these duplicates for merging using [this guidance](/librarians/standards/mergingstandards/#merging-books).

## Book Title
### Titles & Translations
While Edition titles for a particular book may differ, the Book-level title is the one used throughout Hardcover in search results, lists, and within user libraries. In order to maintain consistency, Hardcover uses the official English title if one exists.

In the case of a book originally published in a language other than English, use an official English Translation if available. Otherwise, the original, untranslated title may be used. Under no circumstance should an unofficially translated book title be used.

In the case where two official, regionally specific titles exist, Hardcover defers to the most widely recognized English title. That means there's no hard and fast rule. If in doubt, use the US English title or ask in the <a href={URLS.LIBRARIAN_DISCORD} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#librarians</a> Discord channel for advice.

**Examples include:**
- **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone** (US) vs Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (UK)
- **The Satsuma Complex** (UK) vs **The Clementine Complex** (US)

### Series Names in Titles
A book published as part of a franchise may include the franchise or series name in its title. These are often published inconsistently. To maintain order on Hardcover, let's look at an example:

_Star Wars: Brotherhood_ was published as such, with other books in the Star Wars standalone series following different conventions such as _Lords of the Sith: Star Wars_ or _Bloodline (Star Wars)_. 

Hardcover's preference is to use series titles as a prefix, only where the published title includes it.

This would not apply to books like _The Fellowship of the Ring_ or _Carl's Doomsday Scenario_ where the series title may or may not be part of the book's subtitle. In these instances, it's better to appropriately assign the books to their Hardcover series, leaving the title clean.

### Subtitles
Some books titles may include subtitles, separated by a colon. Hardcover handles these by rendering the subtitle beneath the base title. No additional truncation needs to be done on the user's part.

**Examples:**
- _Babel, or The Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators’ Revolution_

## Headline
A headline is a short, catchy summary used to grab the reader's attention, convey the essence of the book, and persuade them to buy. Often, this is included at the beginning of a book description on a Publisher's website or a bookseller's listing.

**Examples:**
- "A man. His ex-girlfriend's cat. A sadistic game show unlike anything in the universe: a dungeon crawl where survival depends on killing your prey in the most entertaining way possible." - Dungeon Crawler Carl
- "A controversial tale of friendship and tragedy during the Great Depression." - Of Mice and Men
- "The bestselling author of Ilium transforms the story of the ill-fated Franklin Expedition into a devastating historical adventure that will chill you to your core." - The Terror

Hardcover supports short headlines like these supplied by the publisher. If there isn't one available, this field may remain blank. Refrain from inventing headlines or using overtly promotional copy. See the description section below for more on that.

## Description
### Sourcing Book Details

Hardcover wishes to reflect the author and publisher's intentions for their books. Accepted sources for book description are as follows, in order of authority.

1. Publisher
2. Author Official Website
3. Library of Congress / WorldCat
4. Booksellers (Barnes & Noble, Amazon, etc)
5. Other Book Data Sources (Open Library, Google Books, etc)

### Undesired Content 
Book descriptions should be constrained to a spoiler-free introduction or summary of the book. Additional promotional information should be removed, even if it is present in the description of on the most authoritative source.

**Examples of content to remove:**
- "From the author of best-selling series ____."
- Book blurbs from other authors.
- Excerpts from publicized reviews.
- Information about specific editions (reprints, anniversary editions, etc.)

## Cover Edition
Each book on Hardcover has four dropdown fields available for selecting the best default edition of a book. These are used in various ways throughout the platform. The most important of them is the "cover edition."

The cover edition is the edition of the book from which some key metadata is pulled for display on the book page. Most notably, image and page count. Hardcover recommends using the most recent Hardcover edition as the cover edition. If that edition is poor in quality for any reason, please take the time to update the edition to meet the [edition standards](/librarians/standards/editionstandards/).

## Literary Type
Literary type categorizes a book into fiction or non-fiction. Often, the default is set to "unknown." When adding a book, please be sure to check this field to better improve individual stat data for readers.

## Book Category
To further categorize a book, a number of book categories are available with more to come in the future. These categories often influence how books are organized on Author pages so it's important to file them correctly. Below are the categories that exist today with a description of when they should be used.

- **Book:** A standard book. If a title doesn't fall into any of the categories below, it belongs here.
- **Novella:** A book shorter than a novel, but longer than a short story. Lines are fuzzy, but usually these are between 80-160 pages.
- **Short Story:** A brief piece of prose fiction, shorter than a novella.
- **Graphic Novel:** Catch-all for comics, manga, or other predominantly illustrated narrative material.
- **Fan Fiction:** Fiction typically written in an amateur capacity, unofficially leveraging existing intellectual property.
- **Research Paper:** Scholarly literature such as scientific journals.
- **Poetry:** Either a single work or collection of poetry.
- **Collection:** A number of works, by one author or many, collected into a single volume. Different from a compilation, see below.
- **Web Novel:** Written works of literature available primarily or solely on the Internet
- **Light Novel:** A light novel is a type of popular literature novel from Japan usually classified as young adult fiction.

Proposed categories that have not yet been added include: study guides, samples, and periodicals, and textbooks

Often these categories are dictated by the publisher or author, making guesswork unnecessary. If there is any confusion about which of these to use and when, please ask in the <a href={URLS.LIBRARIAN_DISCORD} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#librarians</a> Discord channel for advice.

## Compilation
On Hardcover, a compilation denotes multiple books published within one volume. This differs from a collection in that we construct an additional hierarchy to show which books are contained. These can be set on the book by a librarian.

We recognize that the terminology here can be confusing. Just know that setting a compilation flag will display the book in a separate tab on the author page, allowing their primary works to be shown front and center, without additional clutter.

## Series
Another hierarchy available to users of Hardcover are series. These collect related books and can be sorted by their place in the series.

After adding a series to the book by search or by creating a new one, place is determined by two fields: Place in series number and text.

- **Place in Series (number):** This dictates where in the series the book falls.
- **Place in Series (text):** This dictates what is displayed in series lozenges. Accepts numbers, dashes, and commas only.
