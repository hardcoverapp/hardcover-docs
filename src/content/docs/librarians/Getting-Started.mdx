## The Librarian role

Librarians are trusted members of the Hardcover community who have been granted additional editing privileges. They are volunteer editors tasked with the responsibility of maintaining data quality across the platform.

## Eligibility

Anyone with a passion for books and data can apply to become a librarian. There are no strict prerequisites like number of books read or technical skills - we welcome volunteer contributors who are detail-oriented and want to help maintain our book database. Every new librarian application is reviewed by the Hardcover team for approval. 

We look for users who have shown genuine interest in the platform and will uphold our data standards. It helps to have at least a month of activity on the platform and a good history of reports. If you're enthusiastic about keeping book information accurate and complete, you're eligible to apply!

## Application Process

Simply fill out the <a href={URLS.LIBRARIAN_APPLICATION} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">librarian application form</a> on our website. After you submit your application, you will be required to join our <a href={URLS.DISCORD} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a>. Once there, the team will review your application. There’s no set timeline for approval, but feel free to ping `@team-librarians` if you have been waiting for over a month.

If approved, you will receive an email with further instructions on how to get started as a librarian. You'll also be asked to <a href={URLS.LINK_ROLES} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link your role</a> to grant you access to our <a href={URLS.LIBRARIAN_DISCORD} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#librarians</a> collaboration channel, where you can ask questions, get clarification on policies, and receive help from other librarians and the Hardcover team.

## Responsibilities

Librarians are volunteer editors, they can contribute as much or as little as time allows. The role and its enhanced privileges come with the responsibility of maintaining data quality. They are expected to follow the standards and operate within guidelines outlined on this site. They use good judgment when taking action around the platform and ask questions when unsure.

We expect librarians to act in good faith and aim for accuracy and consistency in the database. The librarian role is not a status symbol or a way to gain influence - it is a shared responsibility to help keep Hardcover's data accurate and reliable for all users.

The community of librarians is collaborative and supportive. The <a href={URLS.LIBRARIAN_DISCORD} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#librarians</a> channel is a great place to discuss tricky edits, ask for help, and share knowledge. We operate with a collaborative spirit - no one is expected to know everything, and we all learn from each other. Contributions of any size are welcome and appreciated.

## Access & privileges

As a librarian, you can edit most [book](./standards/bookstandards/), [edition](./standards/editionstandards/), [series](./standards/seriesstandards/) and [author](./standards/authorstandards/) fields in the database. We plan to expand librarian abilities to other data types as well (characters, publishers, etc.)

Other tools available include options to flag duplicates (for [merging](./standards/mergingstandards/)) or split incorrectly merged editions. High-impact actions (like merging popular books or deleting entries) may require additional approval from a Senior Librarian on the Hardcover team.

## Combining Supporter roles

If you are already a librarian, you can also <a href={URLS.MEMBERSHIP} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become a supporter</a>. Supporters inherit all of the editing powers enjoyed as a Librarian plus a profile badge, early-access features, and other perks yet to come while directly funding Hardcover's ongoing development.

Many volunteers choose to be both: your librarian privileges stay permanent, and the supporter benefits stay active for as long as your paid plan is. If you are already a librarian and cancel your supporter membership, only the extra perks tied to the subscription disappear. Your librarian status (and its editing privileges) remain unchanged.
