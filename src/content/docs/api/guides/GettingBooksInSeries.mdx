## Introduction

This guide will show you how to fetch the books in a series using the Hardcover API.
It also includes notes on how to handle duplicates to get a single list of all the books in the series as they appear on the website.

## Explanation

The data on Hardcover is continuously cleaned up by our team of librarians, but duplicates may still exist when requesting data on a series.
You can avoid this by picking only the most popular book for each position in the series and filtering out merged books.

To hide already merged books you can add a filter that removes books that have a canonical version.

```graphql
book_series(
  where: {book: {canonical_id: {_is_null: true}}}
) {
# ...
```

To hide duplicate books you can request to get the most popular book (by user count) for each position.
By sorting by position and then user count, and using `distinct_on: position`, you will get exactly one book per position.

```graphql
book_series(
  distinct_on: position
  order_by: [
    {position: asc}, 
    {book: {users_count: desc}}
  ]
) {
# ...
```

<sup><sub>
  NOTE: This result may differ from the website if the most popular book at a position is a compilation. This can be mitigated by using `distinct_on: details` (the text version of position). For compilations, `details` might be '1-3', while `position` would be '1'.
</sub></sup>

You can also help by going to any duplicate books and clicking `Flag` > `Flag as duplicate` ;)

### Example Request
<GraphQLExplorer query={`
query GetBooksBySeries {
  series(
    where: {
      name: {_eq: "Harry Potter"}, 
      books_count: {_gt: 0},
      canonical_id: {_is_null: true}
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    slug
    author {
      name
    }
    books_count
    book_series(
      distinct_on: position
      order_by: [{position: asc}, {book: {users_count: desc}}]
      where: {book: {canonical_id: {_is_null: true}}}
    ) {
      position
      book {
        id
        slug
        title
        subtitle
      }
    }
  }
}
`}description={`
Search for series with the name "Harry Potter" that have at least one book and are not merged into another book.
`} title="Search List Books" presentation='json' />

This example query also adds filters for empty and merged series. This is not needed if you match by `slug` or `id` since they are unique.
