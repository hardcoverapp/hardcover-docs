## Introduction

This guide will show you how to fetch the books in a series using the Hardcover API.
And will include notes on how to handle duplicates, to get a single list of all the books in the series as it appears on the website.

## Explanation

The data on Hardcover is continuously being cleaned up by the team of librarians, but often times when requesting data on a series there will be duplicates.
This can be countered by only picking the most popular book in each position in the series, as well as filtering out already merged books.

To hide already merged books you can add a filter that removes books that have a canonical version.

```graphql
book_series(
  where: {book: {canonical_id: {_is_null: true}}}
) {
# ...
```

To hide duplicate books you can request to get the most popular book (by user count) for each position.
Sorting by the position and then the user count and calling distinct on the position you will get one book at each position.

```graphql
book_series(
  distinct_on: position
  order_by: [
    {position: asc}, 
    {book: {users_count: desc}}
  ]
) {
# ...
```

<sup><sub>
  NOTE: This will have different from what is on the website if the most popular book at a position is a compilation, this can be mitigated by doing distinct on `details` which is the text version of `position`, and for compilation it will show as, for example `1-3`, while position would just say `1`.
</sub></sup>

You can also help by going to any duplicate books and clicking `Flag` > `Flag as duplicate` ;)

### Example Request
<GraphQLExplorer query={`
query GetBooksBySeries {
  series(
    where: {
      name: {_eq: "Harry Potter"}, 
      books_count: {_gt: 0},
      canonical_id: {_is_null: true}
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    slug
    author {
      name
    }
    books_count
    book_series(
      distinct_on: position
      order_by: [{position: asc}, {book: {users_count: desc}}]
      where: {book: {canonical_id: {_is_null: true}}}
    ) {
      position
      book {
        id
        slug
        title
        subtitle
      }
    }
  }
}
`}description={`
Search for series with the name "Harry Potter" that have at least one book and ware not merged into another book
`} title="Search List Books" presentation='json' />

This example query also adds filters for empty and merged series. This is not needed if you match by `slug` or `id` since they are unique.
