## Introduction

This guide will show you how to fetch the books in a series using the Hardcover API.
It also includes notes on how to handle duplicates to get a single list of all the books in the series as they appear on the website.

## Explanation

The data on Hardcover is continuously cleaned up by our team of librarians, but duplicates may still exist when requesting data on a series.
You can avoid this by picking only the most popular book for each position in the series and filtering out merged books.

To hide already merged books, you can add a filter that removes books that have a canonical version.

```graphql
book_series(
  where: {book: {canonical_id: {_is_null: true}}}
) {
# ...
```

To hide duplicate books, you can request to get the most popular book (by user count) for each position.
By sorting by position and then user count, and using `distinct_on: position`, you will get exactly one book per position.

```graphql
book_series(
  distinct_on: position
  order_by: [
    {position: asc}, 
    {book: {users_count: desc}}
  ]
) {
# ...
```

This ensures the series list is free of duplicates. However, if the series contains any compilation or collection books, they will still be returned. 
To exclude them, you can filter out books where `book_series.compilation` is true.

```graphql
book_series(
  where: {compilation: {_eq: false}}
) {
# ...
```

<Aside type="note">
  For compilations, there is a difference between the `details` and `position` fields.
  For standard books, `details` is simply a string representation of `position`.
  However, for a compilation, `details` might be a string like '1-3', while `position` would still be '1'.

  Using `distinct_on: details` can be useful if you only want to retrieve one compilation for each book range.
</Aside>

You can also help by going to any duplicate books and clicking `Flag` > `Flag as duplicate` ;)

### Example Request
<GraphQLExplorer query={`
query GetBooksBySeries {
  series(
    where: {
      name: {_eq: "Harry Potter"}, 
      books_count: {_gt: 0},
      canonical_id: {_is_null: true}
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    slug
    author {
      name
    }
    books_count
    book_series(
      distinct_on: position
      order_by: [{position: asc}, {book: {users_count: desc}}]
      where: {
          book: {canonical_id: {_is_null: true}},
          compilation: {_eq: false}
      }
    ) {
      position
      book {
        id
        slug
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
`} description={`
Search for series with the name "Harry Potter" that have at least one book and are not merged into another book.
`} title="Search List Books" presentation='json' />

This example query also adds filters for empty and merged series. This is not needed if you match by `slug` or `id` since they are unique.
