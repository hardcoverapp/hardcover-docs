## What Is an Activity?

Activities are actions that users perform on the platform.
These actions include things like liking a book, following a user, or adding a book to a shelf.
Activities are used to show what users are doing on the platform and to help users discover new content.

There are many types of activities that can be performed on the platform. Some examples include:

- A user adds a book to a shelf
- A user creates a list
- A user adds a book to a list
- A user reviews a book
- A user marks a book as read
- A user answers a prompt

See some [example payloads below](#example-payloads) for more information on the different types of activities.

## Query Examples

Let's take a look at some example queries that you can use to interact with the activities schema.

### Get My Activities
<GraphQLExplorer query={`
{
    activities(where: {user_id: {_eq: ##USER_ID##}}, limit: 10) {
        event
        likes_count
        book_id
        created_at
    }
}
`} description={`
    This query will return a list of 10 activities that the current user has performed.
`}
    title="My Activities"
    presentation='table'
/>

### Get Activities for a Specific Book
<GraphQLExplorer query={`
{
      activities(
            order_by: {created_at: desc}
            where: {book_id: {_eq: 10257}, event: {_eq: "UserBookActivity"}}
            limit: 10
      ) {
            data
            event
            object_type
            book_id
      }
}
