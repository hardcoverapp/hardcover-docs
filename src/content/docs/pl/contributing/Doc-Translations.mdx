# Translating Exising Pages

<Steps>
    1. Go to the page you want to translate.

    2. Using the language dropdown at the top of the page, select the language you want to translate the document into.

    3. Click the "Edit page" button at the bottom of the page.

    4. Translate the content into the selected language.

    5. After making your changes click the "Commit changes..." button at the top of the page.

    6. In the modal that appears, add a title and description to describe your changes, then click the "Propose changes" button.

    7. In Discord ping @Revelry to review your changes.

# How to reference UI elements in translations

Since the Hardcover app is currently only available in English,
you should write the documentation pages with the English labels but also include what the translation should be.

For example, if you are translating a page that references a button with the label "Save",
you should write the page with the button labeled as "Save" and include the translation in the page content like so:

```
Click the <kbd>Save</kbd> button to save your changes.
```

Would become:

```
Haga clic en el botón <kbd>Save</kbd> "Guardar" para guardar los cambios.

```

# Adding new languages to the language dropdown

The root language should **not** be changed from English.
To add a new language, see [Starlight - Configure i18n](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#configure-i18n).

When adding a new language,
you should also update the existing translations in the astro config file to include the new language.
