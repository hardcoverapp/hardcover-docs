## Introduction
Our API is accessible using GraphQL. The API that you can use is exactly the same API used by the website, iOS and Android apps.
This means that you can build your own tools and services that interact with the same data that you see on the website.

The API is currently in beta, and we are actively working on it.
We are currently looking for feedback on this API.

### Getting Started Quick Guide
<Steps>
    1. Get your API key
    2. Make your first request
    3. Read the API references and Guides on this site
    4. Build something awesome and share it with us on <a href={URLS.DISCORD} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a>!
</Steps>

## Getting Help

## Getting an API Key
To get an API token, you need to go to your account settings page and click on the "Hardcover API" link,
the token will be available at the top of the page.

API tokens are not meant to be shared, and should be kept private, as they can be used to access your account and data.

After you have your token, you can start making requests to the API.

## Making Your First Request
After you have your token, you can head over to the [GraphQL console](https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?endpoint=https://api.hardcover.app/v1/graphql).
Next, add a header just called "authorization" (no quotes) with your token as the value.

Tab out of the field, and you should see a list of available resources.

### Example Request
To test that it's working, go to the `Try it Yourself` tab below
- Add your token to the `Authorization Token` field.
- Then click the `Run Query` button.

You should see your user ID and username in the Results section.

<GraphQLExplorer query={`
query {
    me {
        id,
        username
    }
}
`}/>

## API Response Codes
The API will return the following response codes:

| Code | Description                                                  | Example Body                                |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 200  | The request was successful                                   |                                             |
| 401  | Expired or invalid token                                     | `{ error: "Unable to verify token" }`       |
| 403  | User does not have access to the requested resource or query | `{ error: "Message describing the error" }` |
| 404  | Not Found                                                    |                                             |
| 429  | Too Many Requests, try again later                           | `{ error: "Throttled" }`                    |
| 500  | Internal Server Error                                        | `{ error: "An unknown error occurred" }`    |

## Important Notes About the Hardcover API
- The API is still heavily in flux right now. Anything you build using it could break in the future.
- We may reset tokens without notice while in beta.
- The same ownership rights exist for this as anything on the site.
You own your data.
This means you can't use the API
to access and use someone else's data.
- This API is running the same as if you were using the browser. Any actions you take will be under your user.
- #### <span style="color:red">Don't share your token! Someone could delete your account with it.</span>
- This should only be used from a code backend â€” never from a browser.
- This is only for offline use at this time.
You can only access this API from localhost or APIs.
Later on, we hope to
allow developers to join a group that allowlists specific sites, but that's a way down the line.

## Limitations
- API tokens automatically expire after 1 year, and reset on January 1st.
- API is rate-limited to 60 requests per minute.
- The following queries are disabled:
    - `_like`
    - `_nlike`

    - `_iregex`
    - `_regex`
    - `_nsimilar`
    - `_similar`
- Queries have a max timeout of 30 seconds.
- Queries are not allowed to run in the browser, they must be run in an environment where the token can be kept secure.
