## Developer FAQs

### How is the project structured?

#### File Structure

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory.
Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### How do I run the project locally?

#### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RevelryPlay/hardcover-doc.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd hardcover-doc
```
3. **Install dependencies:**
 ```bash
 npm install
  ```
4. **Start the dev server:**
 ```bash
 npm run dev
  ```
5. **Open your browser**
6. **Navigate to `http://localhost:4321`**

#### 🧞 Commands

The Hardcover documentation site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).
All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

### How do I add a new page or update an existing page?

#### Adding a New Page

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `src/content/docs/` directory.
2. Give the file a name that describes the content.
3. Add frontmatter to the top of the file.
 - At a minimum, include `title`, `category`, and `layout`.
  - Both `title` and `category` are strings.
  - Current categories are `guide` or `reference`.
  - `layout` should be the relative path to `/src/layouts/documentation.astro`.
 - We would also recommend including `description` and `lastUpdated`.
  - `description` is a string that will be used as the meta description for the page.
  - `lastUpdated` is a string in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` that will be displayed on the page.
 - Optionally include other fields from
the [Starlight - Frontmatter Reference](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/) page.
 - See `src/content/docs/getting-started.mdx` for an example.
4. Add content to the file using Markdown or MDX syntax.
5. Add the new page to the sidebar
 - If the page is part of the `api/GraphQL/Schema` section the sidebar will automatically update with the new page.
 - If the page is part of the `guides` section the sidebar will automatically update with the new page.
 - All other pages will need to be added to the astro config file
see [Starlight - Add links and link groups](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/#add-links-and-link-groups)
for more information.

#### Available Components

In addition to the standard [Starlight - Components](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/), the Hardcover
documentation site includes the following custom
components:

##### GraphQLExplorer

This component allows a user to view GraphQL queries and experiment by running them against the API.

**Import Path:**

This should be a relative path to the following file:

```js
import GraphQLExplorer from '/src/components/GraphQLExplorer/GraphQLExplorer.astro';
```

**Parameters:**

- `query` - A string containing the GraphQL query to be displayed in the explorer.
- `canTry` - A boolean value determining whether the user can run the query in the explorer. The default is `true`.

**Usage:**

```mdx
<GraphQLExplorer query={query} />
```

### How do I add a new language to the language dropdown?

The root language should **not** be changed from English. To add a new language see [Starlight - Configure i18n](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#configure-i18n).

When adding a new language you should also update the existing translations in the astro config file to include the new language.

### How do I add a translation for an existing language?

Once a language has been added to the astro config file you can create a new file in the `src/content/docs/` directory
inside a folder named with the language code. This new file should have the same name as the original file you are translating.

For example, if you are translating the `src/content/docs/getting-started.mdx` file into Spanish you would create a new
file at `src/content/docs/es/getting-started.mdx` with the Spanish translation of the content.
