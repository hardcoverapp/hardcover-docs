## What is an Activity?

Activities are actions that users perform on the platform.
These actions include things like liking a book, following a user, or adding a book to a shelf.
Activities are used to show what users are doing on the platform and to help users discover new content.

## Types of Activities

There are many types of activities that can be performed on the platform.
Some examples of activities include:

- A user adds a book to a shelf
- A user creates a list
- A user adds a book to a list
- A user reviews a book
- A user marks a book as read
- A user answers a prompt

See some [example payloads below](#example-payloads) for more information on the different types of activities.

## Example Queries

Let's take a look at some example queries that you can use to interact with the activities' schema.

### Get My Activities
<GraphQLExplorer query={`
{
    activities(where: {user_id: {_eq: ##USER_ID##}}, limit: 10) {
        event
        likes_count
        book_id
        created_at
    }
}
`} description={`
    This query will return a list of 10 activities that the current user has performed.
`} presentation='table'/>

### Get Activities for a specific Book
<GraphQLExplorer query={`
{
      activities(
            order_by: {created_at: desc}
            where: {book_id: {_eq: 10257}, event: {_eq: "UserBookActivity"}}
            limit: 10
      ) {
            data
            event
            object_type
            book_id
      }
}
`} description={`
