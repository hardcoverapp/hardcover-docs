## Author Name
### What is the preference for authors that use double initials in their name? Like “J. R. R. Tolkien” or “J. K. Rowling”?
Some authors use a space between initials in their name, some don’t. Typically, we should use the official name that author goes by with whatever spacing they prefer. The URL slug should use no dashes between initials. For example “jk-rowling” or “jrr-tolkein”.
